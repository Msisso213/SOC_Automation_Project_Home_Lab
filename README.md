# SOC_Automation_Project_Home_Lab
The goal of this home lab is to mimic a SOC environment for identification, containment and eradication of possible threats, by sending alerts to a SOAR platform and emailing the analyst about the details of the alert. This home lab will also showcase some automation and responsive capabilities. This project will include Wazuh as an SIEM & XDR, TheHive for case management and Shuffle Automation for SOAR capabilities. This lab will be divided in 4 parts: 
1. Logical Diagram
2. Tools Configuration
3. Telemetry Generation
4. SOAR Setup
