Here is an explanation of the logical diagram:
1. The Wazuh agent send events to the internet.
2. Internet "sends" the events to the Wazuh manager which will create events.
3. The Wazuh manager sends the alerts to Shuffle.
4. Shuffle will gather information about the alerts and enrich the indicators of compromise (IOCs).
5. Shuffle will send the alerts to TheHive.
6-7. Shuffle will also send an email containing information about the events to the SOC analyst using internet.
8. If an action is required, the SOC analyst will send the informations to the Windows 10 client through internet, Shuffle, and Wazuh Manager.
